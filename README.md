# Order-Management
Relational databases are used to store the products, the clients and the orders. Furthermore, the application should be structured in packages using a layered architecture and should use (minimally) the following classes:
  - Model classes - represent the data models of the application;
  - Business Logic classes - contain the application logic;
  - Presentation classes â€“ GUI related classes;
  - Data access classes - classes that contain the access to the database.
